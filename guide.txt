Step 1: Project Setup

    Description: Set up your Django project environment.
    Actions:
        Create a Django Project:

        bash

django-admin startproject anime_recommender
cd anime_recommender

Create a Django App:

bash

python manage.py startapp recommender

Install Required Packages:

bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn requests

Configure Django Settings:

    Add 'recommender' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.
    Set up the database (default: SQLite, or switch to PostgreSQL for production).

Set Up Git:

    Initialize a Git repository and create .gitignore:

    bash

            git init
            echo "anime_recommender/__pycache__/" >> .gitignore
            echo "anime_recommender/db.sqlite3" >> .gitignore
            git add .
            git commit -m "Initial project setup"

Step 2: Data Collection

    Description: Gather anime data from external sources.
    Actions:
        API Integration:
            Fetch data from AniList or MyAnimeList using their APIs.
            Create a script (fetch_data.py) in the recommender app to collect and store data in your Django models.
            Example: Fetching Data from AniList API
        Create Models:
            Define models in models.py for storing anime, users, and ratings.

        python

from django.db import models

class Anime(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField()
    genre = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    # Add other relevant fields

class UserRating(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    anime = models.ForeignKey(Anime, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.FloatField()

Data Migration:

    Run migrations to create database tables:

    bash

            python manage.py makemigrations
            python manage.py migrate

        Data Population:
            Run your fetch_data.py script to populate the database with initial anime data.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Description: Analyze the data to understand features.
    Actions:
        Use pandas to analyze the anime data.
        Create a Jupyter notebook or a script to visualize key statistics like genre distribution, rating distribution, etc.
        Save insights that can be useful for building the recommendation engine.

Step 4: Building the Recommendation Engine

    Description: Develop the core recommendation logic.
    Actions:
        Collaborative Filtering:
            Use scikit-learn to build a collaborative filtering model based on user ratings.
            Example: Implement user-user or item-item similarity using cosine similarity.
        Content-Based Filtering:
            Use features like genres and descriptions to recommend similar anime.
            Example: Use TF-IDF to process descriptions and calculate similarity.
        Hybrid Model:
            Combine both collaborative and content-based approaches.
        Integrate with Django:
            Write functions in recommender/utils.py to generate recommendations.
            Use Django ORM to query user data and apply the recommendation logic.

Step 5: Backend Development

    Description: Set up Django views, URLs, and API endpoints.
    Actions:
        Create Views:
            In views.py, create views to handle requests and return recommendations.

        python

from django.shortcuts import render
from .utils import get_recommendations

def recommend_anime(request):
    user = request.user
    recommendations = get_recommendations(user)
    return render(request, 'recommender/recommendations.html', {'recommendations': recommendations})

Set Up URLs:

    In urls.py, define routes for the recommendation view.

python

        from django.urls import path
        from . import views

        urlpatterns = [
            path('recommendations/', views.recommend_anime, name='recommend_anime'),
        ]

        User Authentication:
            Use Django's built-in authentication system to manage user accounts.
            Ensure that users are logged in to receive personalized recommendations.

Step 6: Frontend Development

    Description: Build the user interface with Django templates.
    Actions:
        Create Templates:
            Create a recommendations.html template to display recommended anime.

        html

        <h2>Your Anime Recommendations</h2>
        <ul>
          {% for anime in recommendations %}
          <li>{{ anime.title }} - {{ anime.genre }}</li>
          {% endfor %}
        </ul>

        Static Files:
            Add CSS and JavaScript files for styling and interactivity.
        Django Forms:
            Create forms for users to rate anime or search for specific titles.

Step 7: Testing and Deployment

    Description: Test the application and deploy it.
    Actions:
        Write Tests:
            Write unit tests for your views and recommendation logic using Django's test framework.

        bash

        python manage.py test

        Deployment:
            Prepare the project for deployment (e.g., using gunicorn and nginx for production).
            Deploy to a platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
            Set up environment variables for production settings.

Step 8: Enhancements and Scaling

    Description: Add additional features and scale your application.
    Actions:
        Add More Filters:
            Allow users to filter recommendations by genre, rating, or release year.
        Optimize Performance:
            Improve the performance of the recommendation algorithm for faster results.
        User Feedback:
            Collect user feedback on recommendations and refine the model.
        Scaling:
            Optimize the application to handle more users, especially during peak times.

PLUS:

Use django-decouple for managing environment variables.
